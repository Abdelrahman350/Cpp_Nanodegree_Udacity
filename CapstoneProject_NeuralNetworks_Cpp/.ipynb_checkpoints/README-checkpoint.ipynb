    "This project is a simple implementation for a fully connected neural network using C++ for Udacity C++ NanoDegree Capstone Project. The chosen problem to apply this neural network was a simple autoencoder. Autoencoders are a specific type of feedforward neural networks where the input is the same as the output."
